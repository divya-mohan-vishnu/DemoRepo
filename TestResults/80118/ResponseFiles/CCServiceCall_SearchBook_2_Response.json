Shakespeare wrote or contributed to more than 40 plays, ranging from romantic comedies to the profound tragedy King Lear, as well as 154 sonnets. The Shakespeare Book has visual plot summaries of each one, with diagrams to show the intricate web of relationships in plays such as A Midsummer's Night Dream. Commentaries explain Shakespeare's sources and set each drama in context, revealing, for instance, how the warring Protestants and Catholics of his day are mirrored in Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets. Written in plain English and packed with graphics and illustrations, The Shakespeare Book illumines the Bard's world - his marriage, businesses, and friends - and explains how his works became an enduring phenomenon. Whether you need a guide through complex plots and unfamiliar language, or you're looking for a fresh perspective on his well-loved plays and sonnets, this indispensable guide will help you fully appreciate Shakespeare, the man, and the writer. Reviews: \"Generous helpings of illustrations, time lines, plot diagrams, and character guides ensure that even readers in their 'salad days' will enjoy every dish at the Shakespearean feast.\" - Booklist \"Enlightening\" - YA Book Central \"In this latest addition to the series, the Bard comes alive for young aficionados.\" - School Library Journal \"Countless volumes have been written about

Disruption","authors": ["Robert McCrum"],"publisher": "Simon and Schuster","publishedDate": "2021-09-07","description": "\"A remarkable book that takes us to the heart of Shakespeare's art and influence.\"—James Shapiro When Robert McCrum began his recovery from a life-changing stroke, he discovered that the only words that made sense to him were snatches of Shakespeare. Unable to travel or move as he used to, the First Folio became his \"book of life\"—an endless source of inspiration through which he could embark on \"journeys of the mind\" and see a reflection of our own disrupted times. An acclaimed writer and journalist, McCrum has spent the last twenty-five years immersed in Shakespeare's work, on stage and on the page. During this prolonged exploration, Shakespeare’s poetry and plays, so vivid and contemporary, have become his guide and consolation. In Shakespearean he asks: why is it that we always return to Shakespeare, particularly in times of acute crisis and dislocation? What is the key to his hold on our imagination? And why do the collected works of an Elizabethan writer continue to speak to us as if they were written yesterday? Shakespearean is a rich, brilliant and superbly drawn portrait of an extraordinary artist, one of the greatest writers who ever lived. Through an enthralling narrative, ranging widely in time and space, McCrum seeks to understand Shakespeare within his historical context while also exploring the secrets of literary inspiration, and examining the nature of creativity itself. Witty and insightful, he makes a passionate and deeply personal case that Shakespeare’s words and ideas are not just enduring in their relevance – they are nothing less than the eternal key to our shared humanity.","industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13","identifier": "9781643137902"},{"type": "ISBN_10","identifier": "1643137905"}],"readingModes": {"text": true,"image": false},"pageCount": 400,"printType": "BOOK","categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"],"maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging": false,"contentVersion": "1.2.2.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false,"containsImageBubbles": false},"imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language": "en","previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=shakespeare&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api","infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo": {"country": "US","saleability": "FOR_SALE","isEbook": true,"listPrice": {"amount": 19.99,"currencyCode": "USD"},"retailPrice": {"amount": 19.99,"currencyCode": "USD"},"buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1,"listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19990000,"currencyCode": "USD"},"retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 19990000,"currencyCode": "USD"},"giftable": true}]},"accessInfo": {"country": "US","viewability": "PARTIAL","embeddable": true,"publicDomain": false,"textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub": {"isAvailable": true,"acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/Shakespearean-sample-epub.acsm?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf": {"isAvailable": false},"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ZBEeEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed": false},"searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "What is the key to his hold on our imagination?

Across four sections it explores the relevance and responsibility of art to the real world ? to the significant teaching and learning, performance and practice, theory and economies that not only expand the discussion of literature and theatre, but also open the gates of engagement between the life of the mind and lived experience. The collection draws from noted scholars, writers and practitioners from around the globe to assert the power of art to question, disrupt and re-invigorate both the ties that bind and the barriers that divide us. A series of interviews with theatre practitioners and scholars opens the volume, establishing an initial portfolio of areas for research, exploration, and change. In Section 2 'The Practice of Shakespeare and Social Justice' contributors examine Shakespeare's place and possibilities in intervening on issues of race, class, gender and sexuality. Section 3 'The Performance of Shakespeare and Social Justice' traces Shakespeare and social justice in multiple global contexts; engaging productions grounded in the politics of Mexico, India, South Africa, China and aspects of Asian politics broadly, this section illuminates the burgeoning field of global production while keeping as a priority the political structures that make advocacy and resistance possible. The last section on 'Economies of Shakespeare' describes socio-economic and community issues that come to light in Shakespeare, and their potential to catalyse ongoing discussion and change in respect to wealth, distribution, equity, and humanity. An annotated bibliography provides further guidance to those researching the subject.","industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13","identifier": "9781350140370"},{"type": "ISBN_10","identifier": "1350140376"}],"readingModes": {"text": true,"image": true},"pageCount": 352,"printType": "BOOK","categories": ["Drama"],"maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging": false,"contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false,"containsImageBubbles": false},"imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language": "en","previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT500&dq=shakespeare&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo": {"country": "US","saleability": "FOR_SALE","isEbook": true,"listPrice": {"amount": 157.5,"currencyCode": "USD"},"retailPrice": {"amount": 126,"currencyCode": "USD"},"buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-IIMEEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1,"listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 157500000,"currencyCode": "USD"},"retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 126000000,"currencyCode": "USD"},"giftable": true}]},"accessInfo": {"country": "US","viewability": "PARTIAL","embeddable": true,"publicDomain": false,"textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED","epub": {"isAvailable": true,"acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Arden_Research_Handbook_of_Shakespea-sample-epub.acsm?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf": {"isAvailable": true,"acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Arden_Research_Handbook_of_Shakespea-sample-pdf.acsm?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=IIMEEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed": false},"searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This thesis explores Brecht&#39;s adaptations of \u003cb\u003eShakespeare&#39;s\u003c/b\u003e plays, while focusing upon &#39;alienating&#39; strategies that help to expose certain ideologies presented in said plays.
