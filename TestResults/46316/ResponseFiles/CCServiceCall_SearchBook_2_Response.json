It specifically highlights Shakespeare’s use of the archetypal language of astrological symbolism in both obvious and subtle ways. Such references would have been commonly known in Shakespeare’s time, but their deeper significance is lost to modern-day playgoers and readers. The first half of the book describes the Elizabethan worldview and how the seven known planets were considered an integral part of the cosmos and instrumental in shaping human character. The second half of the book examines six of Shakespeare’s best-loved plays in the light of astrological symbolism, showing how they are entirely keyed to a specific zodiacal sign and its associated (or ruling) planet. The chosen plays are A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Macbeth, The Tempest, and King Lear. Each chapter incorporates information and examples from astrological tradition, classical and Renaissance philosophy, Greek and Roman mythology, esoteric wisdom, modern psychology (especially that of C. G. Jung), and great literature. Thoroughly researched and well-illustrated, this book illuminates the plays from a fresh perspective that will deepen and profoundly transform how we understand them.","industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_13","identifier": "9780892546312"},{"type": "ISBN_10","identifier": "089254631X"}],"readingModes": {"text": true,"image": true},"pageCount": 528,"printType": "BOOK","categories": ["Body, Mind & Spirit"],"maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging": true,"contentVersion": "2.5.5.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary": {"containsEpubBubbles": false,"containsImageBubbles": false},"imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language": "en","previewLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=shakespeare&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo": {"country": "GB","saleability": "FOR_SALE","isEbook": true,"listPrice": {"amount": 26.84,"currencyCode": "GBP"},"retailPrice": {"amount": 17.45,"currencyCode": "GBP"},"buyLink": "https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-6AieCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers": [{"finskyOfferType": 1,"listPrice": {"amountInMicros": 26840000,"currencyCode": "GBP"},"retailPrice": {"amountInMicros": 17450000,"currencyCode": "GBP"},"giftable": true}]},"accessInfo": {"country": "GB","viewability": "PARTIAL","embeddable": true,"publicDomain": false,"textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED","epub": {"isAvailable": true,"acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Shakespeare_and_the_Stars-sample-epub.acsm?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf": {"isAvailable": true,"acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/Shakespeare_and_the_Stars-sample-pdf.acsm?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6AieCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed": false},"searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "To celebrate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, this book offers fresh and exciting insights into the ever-popular works of the world’s greatest playwright."}},{"kind": "books#volume","id": "xlidBgAAQBAJ","etag": "s64/kiOQTA8","selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xlidBgAAQBAJ","volumeInfo": {"title": "The Shakespeare Book","subtitle": "Big Ideas Simply Explained","authors": ["DK"],"publisher": "Dorling Kindersley Ltd","publishedDate": "2015-03-02","description": "Learn the entire works of one of the greatest writers of the English language in The Shakespeare Book.

In the years leading up to 1606, since the death of Queen Elizabeth and the arrival in England of her successor, King James of Scotland, Shakespeare's great productivity had ebbed, and it may have seemed to some that his prolific genius was a thing of the past. But that year, at age forty-two, he found his footing again, finishing a play he had begun the previous autumn--King Lear--then writing two other great tragedies, Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra. It was a memorable year in England as well--and a grim one, in the aftermath of a terrorist plot conceived by a small group of Catholic gentry that had been uncovered at the last hour. The foiled Gunpowder Plot would have blown up the king and royal family along with the nation's political and religious leadership. The aborted plot renewed anti-Catholic sentiment and laid bare divisions in the kingdom. It was against this background that Shakespeare finished Lear, a play about a divided kingdom, then wrote a tragedy that turned on the murder of a Scottish king, Macbeth. He ended this astonishing year with a third masterpiece no less steeped in current events and concerns: Antony and Cleopatra. The Year of Lear sheds light on these three great tragedies by placing them in the context of their times, while also allowing us greater insight into how Shakespeare was personally touched by such events as a terrible outbreak of plague and growing religious divisions.

Through a set of tenaciously detailed readings, the book illuminates a number of persistent problems or conflicts in Shakespearean drama - in particular a contradiction between words and things, body and language, which is also explored in terms of law, sexuality and Nature. Language and desire, Terry Eagleton argues, are seen by Shakespeare as a kind of 'surplus' over and above the body, stable and social roles and a fixed human nature. But the attitude of the plays to such a 'surplus' is profoundly ambivalent; if they admire it as the very source of human creativity, they also fear its anarchic, trangressive force. Underlying such ambiguities, the book convincingly shows, is a deeper ideological struggle, between feudalist traditionalism on the one hand, and the emergence of new forms of bourgeois individualism on the other. This book revels how, in the light of our own contemporary theories of language, sexuality and society, we can understand the issues present in Shakespeare's drama which previously have remained obscure.","industryIdentifiers": [{"type": "ISBN_10","identifier": "0631145540"},{"type": "ISBN_13","identifier": "9780631145547"}],"readingModes": {"text": false,"image": false},"pageCount": 128,"printType": "BOOK","categories": ["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging": false,"contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0","imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language": "en","previewLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&dq=shakespeare&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&dq=shakespeare&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink": "https://books.google.com/books/about/William_Shakespeare.html?hl=&id=Mh50NAN6YdUC"},"saleInfo": {"country": "GB","saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook": false},"accessInfo": {"country": "GB","viewability": "NO_PAGES","embeddable": false,"publicDomain": false,"textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED","epub": {"isAvailable": false},"pdf": {"isAvailable": false},"webReaderLink": "http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Mh50NAN6YdUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus": "NONE","quoteSharingAllowed": false},"searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is a bold and original reinterpretation of almost all of Shakespeare&#39;s major plays, in the light of the Marxist, feminist and semiotic ideas of our own time."}}]}
